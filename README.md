## SAIBR: Spectral Autofluorescence Image correction By Regression

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This plugin provides an easy-to-use, GUI-based implementation of SAIBR (Spectral Autofluorescence Image correction By Regression): a simple, platform-independent protocol for spectral autofluorescence correction, especially useful for resolving and quantifying low-level green fluorophores in highly autofluorescent cells and tissues.
