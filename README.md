## SAIBR: Spectral Autofluorescence Image correction By Regression

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This plugin provides an easy-to-use, GUI-based implementation of SAIBR (Spectral Autofluorescence Image correction By Regression): a simple, platform-independent protocol for spectral autofluorescence correction, especially useful for resolving and quantifying low-level green fluorophores in highly autofluorescent cells and tissues.

The method relies on a multi-channel imaging approach, which we describe in full in our paper (preprint available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.19.476881v1)). Please read the paper to familiarise yourself with the method before using this plugin.

## Instructions

Please see the [user guide](saibr_user_guide.pdf) for full instructions on installation and use.
